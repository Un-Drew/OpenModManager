What is this?

That's the Mod Manager but rewritten from scratch with new features:

 - Resizable window
 - Embedded console
 - "Mafia Punch:tm:" button (for killing editor when it not respond)
 - Batch-building more than one mods at once
 - Dark themed
 - Custom workshop uploader (works after int32 overflow issue!)
 - Search bar
 - Script watcher (it auto compile scripts when you modify something in it) - disabled by default
 - Mod list context menu
 ... and more!
