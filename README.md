**OPEN MOD MANAGER**
For A Hat In Time

Because it's still work-in-progress you must compile it by you own using Visual Studio (in my case 2017) - I'll prepare a build script for compiling it without Visual Studio later.

Also you still need to have original Mod Manager executable placed in Binaries directory and OMM executable with depend DLL's must be placed in the same directory as the ModManager.exe.

Only tested with Steam release of the game.
