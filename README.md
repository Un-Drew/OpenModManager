**OPEN MOD MANAGER**

For A Hat In Time


Prebuild binaries you can found at the "Releases" page

Now supports mod uploading via Steamworks API!

You don't need to copy it to the Binaries directory anymore! Only you need to copy original "ModManager.exe" to the directory where ModdingTools.exe is stored and rename it to "ModManager.dll"

Works only with the Steam release of the game.
